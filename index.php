          <p class="quote" style="color:yellow">“Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you
            become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and
          until all living humans read the book.”</p>

        <section id="owners">

          <p style="color:yellow">Our owners have been avid readers from a young age,here is why they love reading in their own words</p>
          <p style="color:yellow">Can't probably sum all that I love about reading at once, but for what its worth, why I love them a lot for one is because
Books let you fight dragons,travel to faraway lands, meet the love of your life, and laugh alongside your friends, all within their pages. They're the kind of escape, that brings you home- <span><b>HARSH SHUKLA</b></span></p>
<p style="color:yellow">Reading gives us someplace to go, when we gotta stay where we are. And maybe, this is why we read, and why in moments of darkness, we return to books: to find words, for what we already know- <span><b>AYUSH GUPTA</b></span></p>
